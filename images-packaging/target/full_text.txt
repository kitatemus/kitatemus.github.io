Many restaurants in the Rochester area offer a specific dining experience-
simply more than a diner plate and the bill. Offering customers a unique range
of gluten-free and vegan meals, the Owl House in Rochester NY has become one of
my favorite restaurants; and so, deserving of an equally specified brand. It is
required of a strong brand to have connection between typography and imagery.
This is an element I stressed within designing the face of this unique eatery.
