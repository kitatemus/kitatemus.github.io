The band "Dead Witch" produces music which is fast, loud and a throwback to many
heavy metal acts of the 1990s. Ideally, I personally find memorable album
covers are graphic in nature and require little to no text. The idea of something
to be dead, can also mean extinct, insignificant or simply "gone". These were
elements which guided me through this process.
