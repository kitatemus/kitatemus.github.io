Without understanding your client, you will never understand what form your product
needs to take. Forge had requested a label which displayed the powerful, yet
delicious sauce within their bottle. The goal of a designer should be to push
one's self to new boundaries as often as possible.

Taking a new approach towards the project, Forge brand hot sauce is sold
throughout local vendors in Rochester, N.Y. These include Leo's Bakery, Skips
Meat Market, Herrema's Grocery (at left) and Hart's Local Grocers (shown below).
