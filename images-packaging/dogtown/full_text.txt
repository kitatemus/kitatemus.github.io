Dogtown Hots located in Rochester N.Y. is a staple for burgers, hot dogs and more.
I have always been obsessed with the idea of non-living items, coming to life
and how they might act or live. The ambiguity of the hot dog, alive and controlling
the condoments, represents the quality of this one of a kind Rochester tradition.
