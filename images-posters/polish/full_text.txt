I was asked to create a poster for an exhibit to be held later this year,
displaying RIT's extensive collection of over 200 original Polish posters.
I attempted to separate myself from the obvious illustrative route (used
heavily by the Polish) and utilize photography to represent what the Polish
poster artists are truly about.
